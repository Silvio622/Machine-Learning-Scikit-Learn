## Project Overview
In this project contains two jupyter notebooks and some other files what are relevant to the project . The first is the "scikit-learn.ipynb" notebook where I use different machine learning techniques to investigate different data sets to make predictions for future outcomes.<br>
The second is the "scipy-stats.ipynb" notebook where I do hypothesis testing on two data sets. I use two statistical test methods t-testing and ANOVA testing. <br>

## What is Machine Learing?
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence AI.<br>

## What is Statistics?
Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.

## Project Installation
The project uses the Python package [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It can run on different operation systems. Some additional python packages and libraries are required to run the notebook. The best way to install the python packages using "pip". Please find a list of additional packages and libraries on the requirements.txt file. The notebook is running in any web browser.

## How to run this notebook

you have three options to run this notebook
* Option 1 from your local machine
    1. Download and Insatll [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with<br>
    additional packges listed in the reqirement.txt file.
    2. Download and Install [Commander](https://cmder.net/) for your Operation System
    3. Insert the path where the notebook files are loacated
    4. Run notebook by typing jupyter lab or jupyter notebook into the Commander command line
    5. Pick the `scikit-learn.ipynb` or the `scipy-stats.ipynb` file
    6. When notebook file is open<br>
        Click on "Kernal" tab<br>
        Click on "Restart" Button<br>
        Click on "Cells" tab<br>
        Click on "Run All"  
    7. Alternative Click on each cell and use the keyboard keys "Shift + Enter"       
    <br/>
